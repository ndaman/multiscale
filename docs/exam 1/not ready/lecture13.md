\[sections numbered\]

final project
=============

<span>final project</span>

-   Choose some multi-scale problem that we can use techniques from this class in

-   This could be related to research you are doing (modeling composite properties in a 3D-print)

-   You can also choose (or modify slightly) cases 3-6 from the Micromechanics challenge

-   Remember this project is in place of the final exam, you should demonstrate what you have learned in this course

<span>final project</span>

-   There are three main parts to the analysis you will do on the final project

    1.  A simplified model which can be solved using an analytical method (Eshelby)

    2.  A parametric finite element model (validate to Eshelby, then scale to correct volume fraction)

    3.  Some micromechanics software analysis (SwiftComp, CRAFT, MAC/GMC, etc.)

<span>project report</span>

-   In your report you should assume that the reader is already familiar with Finite Elements and the Eshelby method

-   The reader may not, however, be familiar with the micromechanics tool you are using

-   You should describe the method that your chosen software is using (i.e. Variational Asymptotic Method for SwiftComp, Fourier Transforms for CRAFT, Method of Cells for MAC/GMC. etc.)

-   Make some conclusions about the software you are using

    -   Have you demonstrated that the results from this method are correct?

    -   What advantages does it have over analytic methods and finite elements?

    -   Are there cases where you would expect your software to have difficulty?

<span>project rubric</span> Projects will be graded on the following rubric

-   Analytic Model - 25%

-   Finite Element Analysis - 25%

-   Micromechanics Software - 25%

-   Conclusion - 15%

-   General Presentation - 10%

<span>project abstract</span>

-   Homework 5 will be your project abstract

-   Due 3/29 (after Spring Break)

-   Describe what problem you want to solve and what you will use to solve it

-   List a few challenges you expect to face, how they could be overcome

<span>analytical method</span>

-   I think homework 6 or 7 will be over the analytical model for your problem

-   Due date will be provided later

-   This is just to make sure things are on track for your final project
