<h2 id="how-to-use-this-syllabus">How to use this syllabus</h2>
<p>This syllabus provides you with information specific to this course, and it also provides information about important university policies. This document should be viewed as a course overview; it is not a contract and is subject to change as the semester evolves. Any changes to the syllabus will be uploaded to Blackboard and e-mailed to all students (at their e-mail address listed on Blackboard, make sure this is up-to-date). Many University policies are summarized in this document, but a more up-to-date and complete list of University policies can be found at <a href="https://www.wichita.edu/faculty/development/syllabuspolicies.php" class="uri">https://www.wichita.edu/faculty/development/syllabuspolicies.php</a></p>
<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>Students are responsible for knowing and following the Student Code of Conduct <a href="http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch8_05.htm" class="uri">http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch8_05.htm</a> and the Student Academic Honesty policy <a href="http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch2_17.htm" class="uri">http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch2_17.htm</a></p>
<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Many materials and structures consist of multiple phases. Micromechanics models can be used to homogenize a structure at some appropriate scale for more practical modeling. This course will cover the classical mean-field homogenization models. It will also explore several state-of-the-art numerical techniques used in micromechanics modeling, such as the method of cells, variational methods and Fourier transforms in addition to finite element techniques for periodicity.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-a-credit-hour">Definition of a Credit Hour</h2>
<p>Success in this 3 credit hour course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally 3 hours per unit per week with 1 of the hours used for lecture) for instruction and preparation/studying or course related activities for a total of 135 hours.</p>
<h2 id="measurable-student-learning-outcomes">Measurable Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Model periodic structures</li>
<li>Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of micromechanical models</li>
<li>Compare analytical and numerical solutions to multi-scale problems</li>
<li>Define separate analyses in a multi-scale problem</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-textbook">Course Textbook</h2>
<p>The textbook used in this class is: <em>Introduction to Micromechanics and Nanomechanics</em>, Shaofan Li and Gang Wang</p>

<p>Per department policy, final course grades will not be disclosed before the official notifications by the University.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>Tentative homework due dates are given in the course schedule. This course is heavily homework and project driven, as such you are reminded to take extra care of due dates and the student academic integrity policy. No credit will be given for assignments which violate the academic integrity policy.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final Project</h2>
<p>More details on the final project will be given after the third homework assignment. The final project is intended to serve as a cumulative application of all material used in this course, so be sure that you demonstrate the principles you have learned. Your task is to model some multi-scale problem using the techniques taught in this class. You should use at least one micromechanics software tool, compare your results to a converged finite element model, and make an appropriate comparison to an analytical model. Final projects are due on the day of our scheduled final exam, May 11.</p>
